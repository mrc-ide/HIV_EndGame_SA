Contents of THEMBISA v18 folderThe Thembisa v18 folder contains all the model’s txt files which define the parameters, the code (.cpp and .h) for the model and the txt outputs (from when I ran the model). These have already been edited to be able to run on a Unix-like system (MacOS or Linux). There is a unix executable file (“thembisa”) which should contain the compiled model, but I am not sure whether that will run without compiling the model yourself first – see step 5 below. There are some additional files/folders which are mostly backups or relevant to the Microsoft Visual Basic version of the model. I have retained them in case they are used elsewhere. Running THEMBISA on Unix-like systemThese are all the steps that I took to run the model on my computer. Not all of them will be necessary. If you already have homebrew or gcc installed then check that both are up to date and continue from step 3. 1. Install homebrew Type the following into the CLT (see https://brew.sh/ for more details):/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" 2. In the bash shell type the following:export HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1brew updatebrew upgradebrew info gccbrew install gccbrew cleanup 	(this removes previous application/dependency revisions saving considerable space)This will install gcc3. To run programs in gcc you need to change the directory to the local folder you have the Thembisa.cpp and Thembisa.h files inFor example:cd /Users/stefanrautenbach/Documents/Imperial/Research_project/THEMBISAv184. Compile Thembisa by running the following code:g++ -std=c++14 THEMBISA.cpp StatFunctions.cpp mersenne.cpp -o thembisa -O2This should create a unix executable file in the same folder5. To run the model type: ./thembisaThis will take about 45min to an hour to run and should output the following:Read input filesCompleted simulation 100Completed simulation 200Completed simulation 300Completed simulation 400Completed simulation 500Completed simulation 600Completed simulation 700Completed simulation 800Completed simulation 900Completed simulation 1000Changing parameter valuesIn ‘Thembisa.h’ many of the parameter values are defined. This includes the number of years for which to project results (currently set to 46 i.e. up to and include 2030). Many parameters can be toggled on or off by changing from 0 to 1. Others will need to be adjusted in the parameter specific txt file.
